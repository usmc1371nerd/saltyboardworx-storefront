I used the create-react-app to bootstrap this project. I wanted to build a website that I can use for a future endeavor of selling any of my wood working projects. <br/>

Im also trying to learn more about authorization and building a e-commerce website. This website is a going to be a full stack app with a small backend to handle log-in and product data. <br/>
